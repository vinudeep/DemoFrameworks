  Scenario: SimFreeDeviceRemoveValidation
    Given I am an eComm user12
     When I choose 'like new' sim free device
    #  And Land on the 'Tariffs and extra' page
     #Then I SHOULD be able to see both 12 month and 30 days tab just above the tariffs tile on the right hand side, to select the associated Pay monthly tariffs with a text 'Contract length' at the right hand side
      #And Remove copy 'Contract length is 12 months.'
